# CPU Scheduling

This project is a Java-based simulation for various CPU scheduling algorithms. It allows users to input processes manually or generate random burst times and priorities to simulate and visualize how different scheduling algorithms work.

---

## Features
- Simulates the following CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
  - **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
  - **Priority Scheduling**
  - **Round Robin (with user-defined time quantum)**
- Allows manual input of process details or random generation of burst time and priority.
- Displays process information in a neat tabular format.
- Calculates and displays:
  - Gantt chart for process execution.
  - Average waiting time for each algorithm.
